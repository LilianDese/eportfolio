What is an eportfolio (Ministère, 2025)?
Le eportfolio, en tant qu’outil, est défini comme un ensemble évolutif
• de documents et de ressources électroniques capitalisées
• dans un environnement numérique
• décrivant et illustrant l’apprentissage, les expériences, les
compétences ou le parcours de son auteur au travers de différents
flux d’informations.
La démarche renvoie à la réflexion de l’étudiant sur les éléments qu’il
rassemble tout au long de son parcours
• de formation et
• de ses engagements et
• expériences universitaires et extra-universitaires.

--la-d-marche-portfolio-et-ses-outils-35979.pdf

Your e-Portfolio = Your Personal Showcase
• Extended Brand Story → Goes beyond the CV to show depth and
personality.
• Marketing Tool → Includes projects, media, testimonials, and
reflections.
• Authenticity → Demonstrates how you apply your skills, not just list
them.
• Consistency Across Platforms → Align with your CV, LinkedIn, and
other channels.
• Engagement → Allows employers to explore your "brand experience"
at their own pace.

What makes a good lifelong digital
portfolio (for engineering students)
❑ Modular design: easy to add new projects, skills, certificates.
❑ Versioning or snapshots: show growth, iterations, improvements.
❑ Multi-media support: code snippets, CAD designs, diagrams, videos, reports, reflections.
❑ Good clarity & narrative: each project with context—problem, your role, methods,

outcomes, lessons.
❑ Accessibility & longevity: hosted in a place where it won’t disappear; open formats when
possible.
❑ Searchability & visibility: so industry people / recruiters can find them.

❑ Private vs public controls: allow some work to be private if needed (e.g. under NDA).

Discover Free Platforms for Creating a
Lifelong GDPR / EU-data friendly
Digital Portfolio
Tool

What’s good / what features free
version gives you

What to check / possible drawbacks re: GDPR & data
safety

Canva’s Free
Portfolio Website
Builder

Drag-and-drop templates, many free
assets, quick setup, you can publish on
a Canva domain without paying.
(Canva)

Check whether data is stored in EU centres or with
EU-friendly agreements. Also check if user uploads
(photos, etc.) stay under control. Need to check
cookie / privacy settings.

Portfoliobox (free
tier)

User-friendly, designed for portfolios,
no coding needed, nice templates.
Easy to get something up quickly.
(portfoliobox.com)

Free version may have storage limits, possibly forced
domain name (not custom), maybe less control over
cookies / analytics. Check where servers are hosted
(if in EU) and whether they provide a Data Processing
Agreement.

Wix – Free Portfolio
Website

Offers free hosting; good templates;
flexible content (text, images, media).
Easy for students who are not
technical. (wix.com)

Wix is not purely EU-open sourced; check privacy
settings, cookie banner, whether you can disable
third-party tracking. With free plan there may be ads
or Wix branding, which might introduce some extra
scripts. Also need to see where they host data.

Pros & cons: choose wisely among the four
widely used tools for lifelong digital
portfolios (engineering students)
GitHub → best for coding/technical projects.
WordPress → best for mixed content (text, images, projects).
Canva → best for beginners who want a quick, polished look.
Portfoliobox → best for professional showcase with simple setup.
